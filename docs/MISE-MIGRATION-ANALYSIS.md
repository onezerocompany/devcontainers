# mise Migration Analysis: Manual Installations to Replace

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This migration has been successfully implemented. The DevContainers project now uses mise for tool management.

### What Was Implemented

1. **Global mise Configuration** (`images/base/mise-global.toml`)
   - Pre-installs essential tools: Node.js, starship, zoxide, fzf, bat, eza
   - Tools are installed during image build for better performance

2. **Removed Manual Installations**
   - ❌ Node.js via NodeSource repository
   - ❌ Starship installation script
   - ❌ Zoxide installation script
   - ❌ Manual apt installations for fzf, bat, eza
   - ❌ Custom tools.sh script

3. **New User Experience**
   - `tools` command now aliases to `mise ls`
   - MOTD provides instructions for tool management
   - Project-specific tools via `.mise.toml` files

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - README now reflects pre-installed tools
   - Clear guidance on adding project-specific tools

## Executive Summary

This analysis identifies tools currently installed manually in the DevContainers project that could be managed by mise instead. Moving these tools to mise would provide version consistency, easier updates, and reduced Docker image build times.

## Current Manual Installations

### 1. Development Tools

#### Node.js (Currently Manual)
**Location**: `images/devcontainer/Dockerfile:7-8`
```dockerfile
RUN curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash - && \
    apt-get install -y nodejs
```
**Migration Path**: 
- mise has excellent Node.js support via `core:node`
- Add to `.mise.toml`: `node = "20.11.0"`
- Remove NodeSource repository setup

#### Starship (Currently Manual)
**Location**: `images/devcontainer/Dockerfile:29`
```dockerfile
RUN curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh -s -- --yes
```
**Migration Path**:
- Available via mise: `starship = "latest"`
- Removes need for installation script

#### Zoxide (Currently Manual)
**Location**: `images/devcontainer/Dockerfile:115,175`
```dockerfile
RUN curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/main/install.sh | bash
```
**Migration Path**:
- Available via mise registry
- Add to `.mise.toml`: `zoxide = "latest"`

### 2. CLI Tools (Via Package Manager)

#### GitHub CLI (Already in mise.toml)
**Current**: Configured in `mise.toml` but may still be installed elsewhere
```toml
[tools]
"github-cli" = 'latest'
```
**Status**: ✅ Already using mise

#### Development Utilities
These tools are currently installed via apt but have mise support:

- **fzf** - Command-line fuzzy finder
  - Current: `apt-get install -y fzf`
  - mise: `fzf = "latest"`

- **bat** - Cat replacement with syntax highlighting
  - Current: `apt-get install -y bat`
  - mise: `bat = "latest"`

- **eza** - Modern ls replacement
  - Current: Complex apt repository setup (lines 18-23)
  - mise: `eza = "latest"`

### 3. Tools Listed in tools.sh

The `tools.sh` script checks for many tools that could be managed by mise:

```bash
# Tools with mise support:
- bun          # JavaScript runtime
- node         # Already discussed
- dart         # Dart language
- flutter      # Flutter SDK
- java         # Java runtime
- go           # Go language
- rustc/cargo  # Rust toolchain
- terraform    # Infrastructure as Code
- tflint       # Terraform linter
- kubectl      # Kubernetes CLI
- helm         # Kubernetes package manager
- python       # Python runtime
```

### 4. System Dependencies

These must remain as apt installations (no mise equivalent):
- Build essentials (gcc, make, cmake)
- System libraries (libssl, libcurl, etc.)
- Container tools (Docker, iptables, supervisor)
- Shell (zsh)
- Basic utilities (curl, wget, git, sudo)

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Development Tools
1. **Node.js** - Critical for devcontainer CLI
2. **Python** - Common development language
3. **Go** - Popular for cloud-native tools

### Phase 2: CLI Utilities
1. **starship** - Shell prompt
2. **zoxide** - Directory jumper
3. **fzf**, **bat**, **eza** - Enhanced CLI tools

### Phase 3: Language-Specific Tools
1. **bun** - JavaScript runtime
2. **rust/cargo** - Rust toolchain
3. **java** - JVM languages

### Phase 4: Cloud/DevOps Tools
1. **terraform** - Infrastructure management
2. **kubectl/helm** - Kubernetes tools
3. **gh** - GitHub CLI (already done)

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Create Comprehensive .mise.toml
```toml
[tools]
# Core languages
node = "20.11.0"
python = "3.11"
go = "1.21"
rust = "stable"
java = "temurin-21"

# JavaScript tools
bun = "latest"

# CLI utilities
starship = "latest"
zoxide = "latest"
fzf = "latest"
bat = "latest"
eza = "latest"
"github-cli" = "latest"

# Cloud/DevOps
terraform = "1.7"
kubectl = "1.29"
helm = "3.14"
tflint = "latest"

# Mobile development (optional)
dart = "stable"
flutter = "stable"
```

### 2. Simplify Dockerfile
Remove manual installations and rely on mise:
```dockerfile
# Remove these sections:
# - Node.js installation
# - Starship installation
# - Zoxide installation
# - Complex eza repository setup

# Keep only system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    # System tools only
    iptables ipset dnsutils curl sudo libcap2-bin \
    && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

### 3. Update post-create.sh
Ensure it runs `mise install` to install all tools on container startup.

## Benefits of Migration

### 1. **Consistency**
- Single source of truth for tool versions
- Same versions across all environments
- Easy to update and maintain

### 2. **Performance**
- Faster Docker builds (fewer apt operations)
- Smaller base images
- Parallel tool installation via mise

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Simple version switching
- Project-specific tool versions
- No more "works on my machine" issues

### 4. **Maintenance**
- Centralized tool management
- Easy updates via `mise upgrade`
- Better security with official mise registry

## Potential Challenges

1. **Initial Setup Time**: First container start may be slower as mise downloads tools
2. **Cache Management**: Need to ensure mise cache is properly mounted
3. **Offline Usage**: Tools need to be pre-cached for offline development

## Conclusion

Migrating manual tool installations to mise would significantly simplify the DevContainers project while improving maintainability and developer experience. The migration can be done incrementally, starting with the most commonly used tools and expanding over time.

### Priority Order
1. **High Priority**: Node.js, Python, Go (core languages)
2. **Medium Priority**: CLI tools (starship, zoxide, fzf, bat, eza)
3. **Low Priority**: Specialized tools (dart, flutter, specific versions)

The investment in migration would pay off through reduced maintenance burden and improved consistency across development environments.
