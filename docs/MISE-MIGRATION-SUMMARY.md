# mise Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the DevContainers project from manual tool installations to mise-based tool management. This provides better consistency, easier maintenance, and improved developer experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Base Image (`images/base/`)

**Added:**
- `mise-global.toml` - Defines pre-installed tools:
  - Node.js 20.11.0
  - starship (prompt)
  - zoxide (directory jumper)
  - fzf (fuzzy finder)
  - bat (better cat)
  - eza (better ls)

**Modified:**
- `Dockerfile` - Added steps to copy mise configuration and run `mise install` during build

### 2. DevContainer Image (`images/devcontainer/`)

**Modified:**
- `Dockerfile`:
  - Changed base from `ubuntu:22.04` to `ghcr.io/onezerocompany/base:latest`
  - Removed manual Node.js installation
  - Removed starship installation
  - Removed zoxide installation
  - Removed fzf, bat, eza apt installations
  - Updated npm command to use mise-installed Node.js
  - Added `tools` alias to shell configuration

**Removed:**
- `build-context/tools.sh` - Replaced by `mise ls` functionality

**Updated:**
- `build-context/motd_gen.sh` - Now shows mise instructions instead of tool list
- `build-context/post-create.sh` - Only installs project-specific tools from `.mise.toml`

### 3. Documentation

**Updated:**
- `README.md`:
  - Updated features list to show pre-installed tools
  - Changed tool management examples to use mise
  - Added `tools` alias documentation

**Created:**
- `docs/MISE.md` - Comprehensive mise integration documentation
- `docs/MISE-MIGRATION-ANALYSIS.md` - Migration analysis and completion status
- `docs/MISE-MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### 4. Project Configuration

**Updated:**
- `mise.toml` - Removed github-cli (now in global config), added comments

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: All tools managed through single system
2. **Performance**: Tools pre-installed during image build
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to add project-specific tools
4. **Maintenance**: Simpler Dockerfiles, less manual installation code
5. **User Experience**: Familiar `tools` command, clear instructions

## User Impact

### For Existing Users
- `tools` command still works (now shows `mise ls` output)
- All previously available tools still present
- Can add project-specific tools via `.mise.toml`

### For New Users
- Clear instructions in MOTD
- Pre-installed essential tools
- Easy to discover available tools with `mise ls-remote`

## Next Steps

1. Test the new images to ensure all tools work correctly
2. Update any CI/CD pipelines if needed
3. Consider adding more tools to the global configuration based on usage patterns
4. Monitor user feedback and adjust tool selection as needed
