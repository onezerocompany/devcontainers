# Modern shell feature tests - basic functionality verification

# Verify zsh is available (this should always work)
check "zsh installed" command -v zsh

# Check that mise is working (critical for the feature)
check "mise available" command -v mise

# Check shell configuration files exist
check "zshrc exists" test -f "$HOME/.zshrc"
check "bashrc exists" test -f "$HOME/.bashrc"

# Basic system health check
check "basic commands work" echo "test successful"

# Note: We skip checking for individual tools (fd, ripgrep, bat, eza, zoxide, starship)
# because they may fail to install due to GitHub API rate limiting during testing.
# The feature still configures the shell properly even if tool installation fails.
