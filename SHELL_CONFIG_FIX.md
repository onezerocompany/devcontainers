# Shell Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Starship not configured in zshrc** - The devcontainer's configure-shells.sh was checking for "starship init" before adding it, causing the configuration to never be applied.

2. **zshrc override issues** - The base and devcontainer images weren't properly coordinating shell configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated devcontainer/scripts/configure-shells.sh
- Changed the check to use a marker comment (`DEVCONTAINER_CONFIG_APPLIED`) instead of checking for starship
- Improved starship detection to try multiple paths where mise might install it
- Added support for creating .bashrc if it doesn't exist
- Ensured both mise activate and shims are properly configured

### 2. Updated base/scripts/configure-shells.sh
- Added a comment indicating that devcontainer configuration may be appended
- Ensured base configuration is minimal and extensible

### 3. Updated devcontainer/scripts/entrypoint.sh
- Added mise PATH setup before other initialization to ensure tools are available

### 4. Updated devcontainer/Dockerfile
- Added debug-starship script to help troubleshoot issues

## How It Works Now

1. Base image creates a minimal .zshrc with mise activation
2. Devcontainer image appends additional configuration including:
   - Starship prompt initialization
   - Modern CLI tool aliases (eza, bat, zoxide)
   - MOTD display
   - Shell options

3. The configuration is only applied once (tracked by marker comment)
4. Multiple methods are used to find starship installation

## Testing

Use the provided test script to verify configuration:
```bash
./test-shell-config.sh [image-name]
```

Or manually debug in a running container:
```bash
docker exec -it <container> debug-starship
```
