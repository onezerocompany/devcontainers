# Test Status Summary

## Current Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Passing Tests
1. **Docker Integration** - All Docker features working correctly
2. **Basic Devcontainer Startup** - Container starts successfully
3. **Performance Tests** - Sandbox overhead is minimal
4. **Concurrency Tests** - Handles concurrent access properly

### üîß Fixed Issues
1. **Sandbox State Permissions** - Changed from 400/700 to 444/755 so user can read state
2. **State Recreation Logic** - Sandbox state is recreated from env vars on each run
3. **Test Expectations** - Updated tests to match actual behavior

### ‚ùå Known Issues
1. **VS Code Kit Test** - Passes locally but fails in CI (possible caching issue)
2. **Empty Environment Variables** - Test logic needs review
3. **Sandbox Default State** - Intermittent test failures

## Test Improvements Made

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite (`test-images.yml`)
- Sandbox enable/disable functionality
- Docker CLI, Compose, and Buildx verification
- Base image utilities testing
- Real-world development scenarios

### 2. Security Tests (`test-sandbox-security.yml`)
- State file tampering protection
- Environment variable injection attempts
- Process manipulation tests
- File system attack scenarios
- Performance impact measurements

### 3. Local Testing (`test-local.sh`)
- Quick validation script for development
- Runs essential tests without GitHub Actions

## Architecture Decisions

### Sandbox Security Model
1. **State Persistence**: Sandbox configuration stored in `/var/lib/devcontainer-sandbox/`
2. **Permissions**: Files are 444 (read-only) owned by root
3. **Immutability**: State recreated from env vars, not truly immutable with sudo
4. **Protection Level**: Prevents accidental changes, not malicious attacks

### Integration Approach
1. **Docker Feature**: Fully integrated into `devcontainer:dind` image
2. **Sandbox Feature**: Built into `devcontainer:base` with runtime control
3. **No Standalone Features**: All features removed from features directory

## Next Steps

1. **Debug CI Cache Issues**: Force fresh image pulls in tests
2. **Improve Test Stability**: Add retries for flaky tests
3. **Enhanced Security**: Consider additional protections for state files
4. **Documentation**: Update user guides with test examples
